## Overview

Ok Boomer is just what it says on the tin - a no-nonsense zoom mod (or, as we call it around here *boom* mod). Press the boom keybind (**C** by default) to zoom into your game and scroll to adjust the level of booming.

But then again this is not just your ordinary boom mod - open any screen, like your inventory, press **ctrl** + **shift** and your boom keybind at the same time and watch as everything you see enlarges. Yes you got that right, booming into screens is the secondary feature Ok Boomer offers. We were quite close to saying you can "boom everywhere", but then again you can't boom into the loading screen (yet?).

### Features
 - Smooth, adjustable in-game zoom
 - The (probably?) world's first in-screen zoom
 - Impeccable humor
 - High customizability where it matters - including the option to disable all limits, in either direction
 - At least two extra, somewhat hidden features for you to discover 


### Credits
 - [chyzman](https://github.com/chyzman) for inspiring screen booming and the two easter-egg features
 - [EnnuiL](https://github.com/EnnuiL) for her incredible work on Ok Zoomer, which quite unsurprisingly inspired the name of this mod
 - [The Twemoji Project](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) for making their emoji freely available - from which the icon of this mod has been assembled
